We started off the day by learning about online safety and human trafficking from DPD detectives, officers, and members. During our lunch break, attendees were able to visit different stands, with each stand touching on important topics including sexual health/education, suicide prevention, mental health, and LGBTQ+ representation. Each stand also gave multiple opportunities to get involved with the community through their respective programs. Afterwards, we had other officers give talks on recognizing drugs/alcohol and personal safety. Throughout the event, there were also opportunities to win prizes from a raffle.\nOverall, I gained a lot of valuable information from attending the Teen Safety Symposium. Many of the topics that the DPD touched on during the event had memorable lessons that we all walked away with. It was definitely eye-opening to know that just how many Internet-related and human trafficking crimes were happening right in here in Dallas. For many attendees, the talk on online safety was the most helpful. Since a lot of teens spend a good amount of time online, it was definitely important to address the prevalence of Internet crimes and how to protect ourselves.\n","date":"30 Jul, 2022","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/event/dallas-police-teen-safety_hud16a9c21fcc15c8fcf28e6abd6aedf3b_200921_545x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/event/dallas-police-teen-safety_hud16a9c21fcc15c8fcf28e6abd6aedf3b_200921_600x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/event/dallas-police-teen-safety_hud16a9c21fcc15c8fcf28e6abd6aedf3b_200921_700x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/event/dallas-police-teen-safety_hud16a9c21fcc15c8fcf28e6abd6aedf3b_200921_1110x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"w-100 img-fluid rounded\" src=\"/images/event/dallas-police-teen-safety_hud16a9c21fcc15c8fcf28e6abd6aedf3b_200921_1110x0_resize_q95_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"https://www.fascadallas.org/blog/post-2022-07-30/","tags":["Dallas","TeenSafety","2022"],"title":"Safety Symposium hosted by the Dallas Police Department"},{"categories":["Report"],"contents":"For this year\u0026rsquo;s China Heritage Camp, FASCA members and teachers planned several classes and activities for campers and their families to learn more \u0026amp; immerse themselves in Chinese culture.

Teachers Shu Lam and Sara Haviland guided 5 FASCA students in setting up the facility by putting programs and tiger centerpieces on the tables. Before the Gala started Teacher Rosa Lu stopped by to demonstrate techniques of selling raffle tickets. 2 new FASCA members showed up for the second shift while 2 for the morning shift went home. Teachers Shu Lam and Dolly Chen led the second shift of 5 FASCA members. The Gala began with a loud festive lion dance in the banquet room. All FASCA members were busy selling raffle tickets to around 650 guests while teachers helped with ripping raffle tickets and placing them securely into the spinning drum and taking pictures. We helped distribute prize lists and locate small prizes for the lucky winners. At the end of the gala, we cleaned up by gathering programs, collecting envelopes left for the purchases of the tiger centerpieces as well as putting away any unsold ones.\nOverall I had fun volunteering at the event even though it was a long day. I thought selling the raffle tickets was challenging because not everyone wanted to buy from me. At first, I felt discouraged but then I learned not to take it personally and tried my best. After all, it was for a good cause since a part of the proceed goes to help international exchange students study in Dallas. I also learned that by working with fellow FASCA members in doing anything we can accomplish tasks more efficiently and have fun.\n","date":"19 Jul, 2022","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/event/taiwanese-coc-new-year-party-2022_hu06fbab426a4786daac642c037dd25fa8_377943_545x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/event/taiwanese-coc-new-year-party-2022_hu06fbab426a4786daac642c037dd25fa8_377943_600x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/event/taiwanese-coc-new-year-party-2022_hu06fbab426a4786daac642c037dd25fa8_377943_700x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/event/taiwanese-coc-new-year-party-2022_hu06fbab426a4786daac642c037dd25fa8_377943_1110x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"w-100 img-fluid rounded\" src=\"/images/event/taiwanese-coc-new-year-party-2022_hu06fbab426a4786daac642c037dd25fa8_377943_1110x0_resize_q95_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"https://www.fascadallas.org/blog/post-2022-07-19/","tags":["Taiwan","NewYearParty","2022"],"title":"Greater Dallas Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce hosted a Chinese New Year Charity Gala"},{"categories":["report"],"contents":"Please congratulate the following student council members elected yesterday, they will serve in the 2022-2023 school year.

The third act, the New World Dance, was performed by 4 FASCA students. The choreography, costumes, and headdresses were very unique, and displayed the culture of Taiwan. After that, Bella Feng performed a Mendelssohn violin solo. The sword dance, performed by 3 FASCA students, was a very interesting presentation of Chinese culture.\nNext, Jackson Wang performed a euphonium solo and the FASCA students then performed the “I Believe” dance. Finally, a choir consisting of multiple FASCA parents and students, as well as violin and piano players, performed “The Moon Represents My Heart,” and “The New Year Song.” Overall, I think the event was extremely successful, and the audience at Highland Springs Senior living, over 60 people, definitely enjoyed the performances!

Then, the members were split into breakout rooms to work on their individual events — including MC-ing, skit, dance, etc. Afterwards, the members were able to do small-group practices of the 賀新年 ＆ 我的未來不是夢. The FASCA teachers were able to touch-up on students’ pronunciation and successfully bring the song together.\nAs we had already begun the learning stage for the dance, event, and songs, this meeting was important to polish and perfect them for the upcoming event.

Being able to meet with our event groups allowed for scheduling of further practice, as well as brainstorming of ideas to make the performance clearer or better-executed. With the help of the FASCA teachers clarifying the lyrics and melody, as well as the focused breakout rooms, allowed many people were able to pick up on the song’s pronunciation and catch up to the tempo of 賀新年 ＆ 我的未來不是夢. I believe that this practice gave us the chance to be more fully prepared for the February 26th performance.\n","date":"05 Feb, 2022","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/event/highland-springs-senior-living-practice-2022_hu5be9963004692b367a82ff797f9936db_81288_545x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/event/highland-springs-senior-living-practice-2022_hu5be9963004692b367a82ff797f9936db_81288_600x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/event/highland-springs-senior-living-practice-2022_hu5be9963004692b367a82ff797f9936db_81288_700x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/event/highland-springs-senior-living-practice-2022_hu5be9963004692b367a82ff797f9936db_81288_1110x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"w-100 img-fluid rounded\" src=\"/images/event/highland-springs-senior-living-practice-2022_hu5be9963004692b367a82ff797f9936db_81288_1110x0_resize_q95_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"704\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"https://www.fascadallas.org/blog/post-2022-02-05/","tags":["NewYear","2022"],"title":"2022 Southlake Spring Festival"},{"categories":["report"],"contents":"Today, we gathered together at the Dallas Chinese Community Center to celebrate New Year’s Day.

In short, Mr. Hilliam hopes everyone can use their right to protect themselves. In addition, “No matter what major you’re in, the way to get into FBI is to get a master degree,” Mr. Hilliam said.
